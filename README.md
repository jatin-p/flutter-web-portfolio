## 🚀 Motivation


Wanted to learn about cloud using a template and host the website myself on AWS using their services and tools (i.e. S3, CertBot, an EC2 t.2 micro instance) as I had tried Google's firebase to host my <a href="https://github.com/jatin-p/jpNotes">jpNotes app</a> which was quite seemless via command line tools, along with CI/CD through github.

## 🙏 Credits

The design is essentially a fork of a template from Kamran Bekirovyz [Github Repo](https://github.com/kamranbekirovyz/flutter-web-portfolio) which is itself based on an HTML5 template <a href="https://html5up.net">html5up.net</a> called <a href="https://html5up.net/solid-state">Solid state</a>.
