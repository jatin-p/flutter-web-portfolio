A responsive layout; open-source, comment-rich, and clean codebase website built with Flutter web.

## 🚀 Motivation


Wanted to try using a template and host the website myself on AWS using their services and tools (i.e. S3, CloudFront, Certificate Manager, and Route 53) as I had tried Google's firebase to host my jpNotes app which was quite seemless via command line tools.

The codebase is open-source and sparsley commented. Although you can use it any way you want, beware that it (my old website that was built with HTML and CSS to be more specific) was inspired and cloned from an open-source template called <a href="https://html5up.net/solid-state">Solid state</a>. 🤓  

## 🙏 Credits

The design is inspired by a template from Kamran Bekirovyz [Github Repo](https://github.com/kamranbekirovyz/flutter-web-portfolio) which is also based on an HTML5 template <a href="https://html5up.net">html5up.net</a> called <a href="https://html5up.net/solid-state">Solid state</a>.
